Adobe Analytics

This module provides very basic Adobe analytics integration.

Currently this module only:

- Allows customization of which pages analytics are enabled on.
- Adds the service and accessrights meta tags Adobe analytics requires (other metatags should be set with a module like metatag).
- Links Adobe's custom JS required for your Adobe Analytics account.
